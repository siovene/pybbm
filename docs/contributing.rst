Contributing
============

Development happens on github, with main repo: https://github.com/hovel/pybbm

Issues, forks, patches and pull requests live here ;)

There are many ways to contribute to pybbm and you do not need to be a developper to do it:

1) Find a bug and submit an issue. You should:

* explain what was expected
* explain what was really done
* explain how to reproduce (environment, steps etc.)

2) Improve documentation

* you can correct typos or "bad english"
* add a new documentation part (for exemple, a "how to" than could help people when using pybb in
some use-case. eg: how to add news fields to `Topic` model).

3) Fix a bug. You should:

* write a test which should fail because of this bug
* write your bug fix
* run all pybbm tests
* be sure that code coverage does not decrease
* create the pull request

4) Add a new feature:

* quick-document it
* open an issue and discuss about it
* document it completely
* add tests for all parts of this new feature
* write your new feature
* run all pybbm tests
* be sure that code coverage does not decrease
* create the pull request
